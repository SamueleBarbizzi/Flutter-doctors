After 2 minutes of cooking over a high flame, add the peeled tomatoes and season with salt. Cover with a lid and cook for at least 1 hour on a very low heat: the sauce should simmer gently. Stir occasionally. After this time has elapsed, remove the garlic and pass the tomatoes through a food mill to obtain a smooth, homogeneous puree. Return the sauce to the pan, turn the heat very low and add the basil leaves. After a few minutes you can turn off the sauce and keep warm. Now you just have to cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, salted water. Drain the spaghetti al dente directly into the sauce and stir a few moments over a high flame to mix everything together. Your spaghetti with tomato sauce is ready, all you have to do is serve and garnish with fresh basil to taste!',

Add coarse salt. Let the clams soak for 2-3 hours. After this time, the clams will have purged any residual sand, drain and rinse them. Heat a little oil in a pan. Then add a clove of garlic and let it brown. Then plunge the clams into the hot pan. Close the lid and leave to cook for a few minutes over a high flame. The clams will open with the heat, so shake the pan from time to time until they have completely opened. In the meantime, finely chop the parsley. As soon as all the clams have opened turn off the heat immediately, otherwise the clams will overcook. Cook the spaghetti in plenty of lightly salted water for half the cooking time indicated on the packet. Meanwhile, filter the clams, placing a bowl underneath and remembering to remove the garlic. In this way you will collect the clam cooking water in the bowl. Transfer it to the pan where you had cooked the clams and as soon as the spaghetti are ready, drain them, keeping the cooking water aside. Transfer them to the pan with the sauce. Add a ladle of cooking water, season with pepper and finish cooking the spaghetti, adding more water if necessary. When they are ready, add the clams. Add the parsley, toss briefly and serve your spaghetti with clams immediately.',

Once the onion has stewed, pour in the rice and toast it for 3-4 minutes, so that the grains will seal and keep cooking well. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate completely. Now continue cooking for about 18-20 minutes, adding the stock one ladle at a time, as needed, as it is absorbed by the rice: the grains should always be covered. Five minutes before the end of cooking, pour in the water with the saffron pistils you had infused, stir to flavour and dye the risotto a nice golden colour.

    'preparation': 'To prepare chicken cacciatore, start by chopping the vegetables.

Cut it into pieces by separating thighs, breast and wings. At this point you have everything you need, move to the stove. In a saucepan heat a drop of oil, do not overdo it because the skin of the chicken will release a lot of fat. Turn on the flame and let it heat for a few moments, after which pour in the chicken pieces, always starting on the skin side. Let them brown for about 10 minutes, turning after a while. When the chicken is well browned add the chopped celery, carrot and onion and then the hulled garlic clove. Then salt, pepper and rosemary, stir and let it season for another 5 minutes. Deglaze with the red wine and let the alcohol part evaporate completely. Remove the rosemary and garlic clove and then add the chopped peeled tomatoes. Stir it all together and cover with a lid, let it cook over moderate heat for 30-35 minutes. Remember that if the chicken is larger then you will need to increase the cooking time a little more, vice versa if smaller. In any case, the chicken is considered ready as soon as the meat comes off the bones. At the end of cooking make sure it is just right with salt and finally sprinkle with parsley. One last stir and your chicken cacciatore is ready, enjoy!',

After washing and drying them well, peel them and then cut them into chunks of about a couple of centimeters, or at any rate the important thing is that they are all the same thickness. Pour the chunks into a bowl and adjust the oil, salt and pepper and also add the peeled garlic. Add a sprig of chopped rosemary and mix everything together, with your hands or a wooden spoon, then transfer to a drip pan greased with oil and bake, in a preheated oven on static mode, at 200° for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, take care of the meat tying. The first thing to do, however, is to remove the whitish tissues that may become tough during cooking, making the meat not very tender. So with one hand hold up a flap while with the other hand in which you hold a sharp blade, the one for filleting fish will do, go and discard these parts until the piece of meat is completely clean. Now move on to tying it up. Unroll a good bit of kitchen twine and let it go underneath the meat arranged horizontally on the cutting board. Join the two ends together until they form a double knot placed on the outer side: for convenience we start from the left side all the way to the end. Now pass the twine around your hand twice (if you think you can also rotate your hand, so it will knot automatically), until it forms a loop. Then pass the meat inside, tighten the twine by pulling the top or bottom end, until you reach the center. Here is the first knot, repeat like this until the piece of veal is completely caged: meanwhile, remember to leave about an inch of space between each knot. When you reach the end, flip the meat over to the other side, still holding the ends in place, and weld it all together again by making a double knot, obviously on the opposite side from the first. Splint the meat by passing the other sprig of rosemary under the knots and then salt and pepper the cutting board. Place the piece of meat on it and begin massaging it, making the aromatics adhere in all places. Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the meat, letting it seal over medium-high heat on all sides: so every minute or so you will have to turn it with tongs or wooden spoons making sure that the meat browns nicely. When all sides of the piece of meat are well sealed, deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate for a few moments, after which turn off the flame. Bring the meat to the center of the drip pan making space between the potatoes. Sprinkle the piece of veal with the gravy and stick a roasting thermometer into the center of the meat. Continue cooking, still at 200°, until the thermometer reaches 65°, roughly it will take about 35 minutes. After that time has elapsed, your baked veal roast with potatoes  will be ready: wait a few minutes before removing the string and slicing this goodness!',

In a saucepan, crush 2 cloves of garlic, lightly brown them in oil, add the artichokes in wedges and the well-drained stems and sauté them a few moments. Add some chopped parsley, keeping a handful aside (which you will use to sprinkle over the artichokes when the cooking is finished); Also prepare some vegetable broth with which you are going to bathe the artichokes whenever they get too dry, then pepper and salt to your taste. Cooking should go on for about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the size of the artichokes; you will be able to know when it is time to turn off the heat by poking a stem with a fork; it should be tender but not mushy. Serve the artichokes trifoliated as soon as they are ready!',

    'preparation': 'To prepare eggplant Sardinian style, you can use either the elongated violet variety or the round variety. First wash the eggplants and cut them into half-inch slices . Using the blade of a knife, carve each slice of eggplant by making vertical, horizontal and transverse lines to form a checkerboard pattern. This will help the eggplant lose its bitter mood more easily and facilitate even cooking. Salt the eggplant slices and lay them in a colander. Cover them with a plate on which you will place a weight so as to compress them and leave them like this for half an hour so that they lose their bitter liquid. Meanwhile, wash the tomatoes, cut them in half and gently hollow out the inside with a small knife to remove the seeds. Now cut them into half-inch pieces and pour them into a bowl. Now season the tomatoes: add the garlic cloves and the three tablespoons of finely chopped parsley, the salt and finally the oil. Stir and let the chunks of tomatoes soak with the seasoning for a few minutes. Meanwhile, after the half-hour has passed, take back the eggplant slices and check that they have released their bitter water. Rinse them under cold running water and then dry them thoroughly with kitchen paper or a cloth. Then, heat the static oven to 180°-200°. Grease a 34-cm, high-sided baking dish with olive oil and begin by forming a layer of eggplant. Then cover with a layer of chopped cherry tomatoes. Continue in this way until you have used up all the eggplant, as shown in the photo. Then bake the dish, in a preheated static oven and bake at 200° for at least 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve the eggplants hot or cold according to your taste.',

Once this time has passed, drain them and rinse them under running water. Now transfer them to a pot with water (unsalted): the water should completely cover the beans. Cook the beans for 50 minutes with a lid , checking their cooking from time to time: the beans should be tender but not mushy. When there are 3 or 4 minutes left to the end of cooking time, add salt. Once the beans are cooked drain them well and let them cool. Move on to the Tropea onion: cut off the ends, peel it and cut it into very thin rounds. If you prefer a milder flavor from the onion, you can soak it in cold water for at least 1 hour (several hours is better); otherwise continue with the recipe. pour the now-cooled beans into a large bowl, add the onion and drained tuna. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, salt to taste and mix well, helping yourself with a fork and a tbsp. Transfer to a serving dish : your tuna beans and onion are ready to be enjoyed!',

The potatoes will be cooked as soon as they no longer resist, at which point drain them and let them cool a bit finally peel them and let them cool. To cut the cooking time in half, you can cook them in a pressure cooker. Once the boiled potatoes are completely cooled, for convenience and for optimal cutting you could leave them 15 minutes in the freezer, cut them into cubes of a couple of centimeters. Collect the cubes in a bowl and pour in the Greek yogurt along with the chives, which you can cut up with the help of scissors, and stir. If you find that the mixture becomes too thick dilute it by adding 1-2 tbsp of milk, adjust the salt and pepper, stir and store in the refrigerator, covering with plastic wrap. Meanwhile, trim the green beans, then remove the two ends then rinse them under running water and blanch them in plenty of boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes, just long enough to make them a little softer. Then drain the green beans and let them cool a little while also pouring in some cold water to stop the cooking so they will remain a nice green color. Finally arrange the green beans in a bowl and season with salt. On a cutting board arrange the chicken breast slices and salt them only on the surface then spread a little mustard, helping yourself with a tbsp to distribute it. Just above the center arrange a handful of green beans. Starting from the top, roll the chicken slice with the green beans in the middle so that the meat is rolled onto itself and thus obtain a roulade; repeat the operation for all the other slices. Insert two toothpicks for each roulade, this way you will be sure that it will not open during cooking. Pour some extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan and when it is hot lay the roulades, turning them after a few minutes of cooking over high heat and continue so that the meat is sealed well. Let them cool for a few moments and do not discard the cooking oil that will be needed later. Remove the wooden skewers from each roulade and salt the surface that had not been salted previously. On a cutting board arrange the prosciutto slices and starting from the bottom roll the slice all around the roulade so that the prosciutto completely covers the roulade, and do this for everyone. Pour the cooking juices from the rolls into an oven dish and lay them in it, letting them bake in a static oven preheated to 180° for 15 minutes. As soon as the chicken and green bean rolls are cooked you can serve them accompanied by your yogurt potato salad !',

    'preparation': 'To prepare the mushroom risotto, start by cleaning the Porcini mushrooms. Remove the end part of the stem, then peel them using a small knife, to do this start from the base of the cap and gently pull the skin to the center. Then remove the stems as well and keep the scraps aside that will be used to make the broth. At this point take care of making the mushroom broth. Pour the scraps into a saucepan, add water and let them simmer for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, dice the mushroom heads as well and finely chop a half onion. Take a large saucepan that will be used for cooking the risotto, add half the amount of butter (40 g) and let it melt gently. Then add the onion and let it brown before adding the mushrooms. Cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and making sure that the mushrooms do not release liquid. At this point add the rice and stir often so that it is toasted. After a few minutes, deglaze with the white wine and only when the alcohol part has completely evaporated add a couple of ladles of broth, straining it through a colander directly inside the pan. Adjust the salt and continue cooking for about 13 minutes, basting occasionally with the hot strained broth, until it is cooked through. Then turn off the heat and take care of stirring the risotto: first add the remaining 40 g of butter and stir until it is completely melted; then add the Parmigiano and stir again. Now finely chop the parsley; season the rice with ground white pepper, parsley and a drizzle of oil. Stir to blend the flavors and adjust the density of the risotto by adding more broth if necessary, stir again, and serve your mushroom risotto still hot.',
